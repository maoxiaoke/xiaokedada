An Exploaration of FP and Object Composition in JavaScript.

## FP in JavaScript

JavaScript has the most important features needed for FP:

1. First-class fucntions;
2. Anonymous functions and concise lambda syntax;
3. Closures;

What JavaScript is still Misssing:

1. **Purity**: In some FP languages, purity is enforeced. Expressions with side-effects are not allowed. In JavaScript, purity must be achieved by convention.
2. **Immutability**: Some FP languages disable mutations. JavaScript lacks efficient, immutuble trie-based data structures used by most functional languages.
3. **Recursion:** In many FP languages, recursion is the only way to iterate.
